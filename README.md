# AURA
AURA+ is a lightweight, offline AI assistant designed to understand hand gestures and detect real-world objects through a camera feed. Using Mediapipe for gesture recognition and YOLOv8 (pre-trained model) for object detection, AURA+ allows users to interact with their system naturally â€” without touching the keyboard or mouse.
